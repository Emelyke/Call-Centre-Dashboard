## Problem Statement (KPI'S)
-What is the average speed of answer?

-How does the average speed of answer vary by agent?

-Are there trends in unanswered calls across dates and time?

-How many issues were resolved?

-How many calls were answered in total?

-Visualize number of calls per month

-Dashboard Interaction  <a href="https://github.com/Emelyke/Call-Centre-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-01-07%20203555.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
-Conducted data quality assessments to identify and address missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

-Standardized and cleaned datasets to ensure consistency across data types, formats, and categorical values for accurate analysis.

-Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to develop calculated columns, measures, and KPIs for extracting actionable performance insights.

-Developed interactive dashboards using visual analytics tools to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and delivered data-driven recommendations based on insights.

## Project Insight

-There’s a positive revenue-to-cost ratio with a total profit of ₦98M. Indicates strong market engagement and demand for services.

-The export quarterly revenue trend exhibits a steady linear progression between 1 to 1.2 billion, with a high spike in Q4 2021 and the low revenue in Q3 2021 and Q4 2022.

-Sesame, cocoa, and cashew nuts remain the top-performing agricultural export products, with cashew and palm oil closely following as key contributors to the sector’s growth

-Products with lower revenue streams yielded higher profits than some high-revenue products. This variance is attributed to pricing strategies, cost structures, or the volume of units exported, influencing overall profitability.

-Volume of units exported barely influenced the high revenue generated in most products,This variance is attributed to pricing strategies

-Significant losses were incurred due to elevated exportation costs, high port fees, and increased transportation expenses associated with transferring goods from production sites to storage facilities.


## Recommendation:

-To enhance agro-export sector the following is essential;

-Reduce exportation costs and port fees through policy reforms, digitized port operations, and improved logistics efficiency.

-Investment in better transportation networks, including rail and inland waterways, to lower transfer costs and enhance supply chain movement.

-Optimize pricing strategies and focus on value addition (e.g.,systems for processing raw products locally) to maximize profitability.

-Expand storage infrastructure and implement digital tracking systems to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce losses.

-Leverage trade agreements and market intelligence to unlock new export opportunities and strengthen global market position.
